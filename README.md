# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

## Overview:

This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition model for accurately identifying and classifying various hand gestures from image or video data. The goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and support gesture-based control systems.





## Kaggle Dataset:

The dataset for training and testing the hand gesture recognition model can be obtained from Kaggle. Ensure that you download the relevant dataset and organize it appropriately before running the model. You can find a suitable dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)
